## Use cases
Although they are limited, there are *some*
- Setting your system to years above 2099 (Sadly 9k+ doesn't work) (Please check [extremes.md](extremes.md))
- When your Domain Admin disallows you to change the time (looking at you, dkay)
- When Windows breaks and simply doesn't let you sync the time with an NTP server for some reason

## Build
Open the project in Visual Studio (this was made in Visual Studio Community 2022) and build the solution.
