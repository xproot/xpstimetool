# Extreme times
Things to expect while going to these extremes:
- A LOT of CPU Usage.
- Any application requiring time, like cyptography (thus HTTPS), to stop working.
## Minimum (DD-MM 1/1/1601)

The earliest I was able get with the program would be UTC 1/1/1601, this VMs timezone is set to Pacific so it shows as December 31st.
Under Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021, there are two services which use the entirety of the CPU (like in the y10k bug), these stop bugging out once I synced to time.windows.com

In this screenshot I went to the UTC time zone so I could set the UTC date right, the clock applet stopped working so it got stuck in 1/1/1901 even though I changed it back into pacific.
## Maximum (DD-MM 5/12/8907)

The furthest I was able to get with the program would be Pacific 5/12/8907, putting any time wouldn't work.
For some reason Firefox was using a lot of CPU, I can't really say if this was the date's fault.
